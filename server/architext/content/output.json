You'll need to explore it, find clues and solve puzzles in order to discover what happened to its inhabitants.\n\nThe game lasts between 20-60 minutes. 2 to 4 players are recommended so consider bringing some friends with you. You can communicate using the say and shout verbs, or use a voice chat app like Discord. (You can join our official discord server here: https://discord.com/invite/CnQD9g3U5g )\n\nIn the monastery you'll JUST need to use these verbs:\n  look <item> - to take a close look and find clues\n  go <exit> - to travel between the different rooms\n  exits - conveniently lists the obvious exits of the room\n  items - lists the obvious items of the room\n\nWhen you enter a room first read its description. Then you can use the \"look\" verb to investigate all things you found there. When you have finished investigating, use the \"go\" verb to travel between rooms and keep exporing! You can use the \"exits\" and \"items\" verbs to see what you can interact with in the room if you get stuck.\n\nKeep in mind that there may be hidden item or exits, and these won't be listed by the \"exits\" or \"items\" verbs! Carefully reading item decriptions will allow you to find them.\n\nAlso, I recommend you to open a notepad so you can copy-paste cryptic clues that you may find. They may become meaningful later.\n\nNow go through the portal, and good luck!",
