Just write \"help\" to see it. There you can learn all that there is to know.\n\nEverything you have seen has been created by an architext like you. Did I mention that!? If you don't believe me, write \"build\" to start creating a room right here. Or \"craft\" to create an item! Its easy :-)\n\nThis is just a tiny part of the multiverse. Write \"exitworld\" to go to the lobby. There you can go to other worlds and create your own. \n\nWhat to do next? Visit the Monk's Riddle world. It is an immersive escape game that lasts 30 to 60 minutes. It is better played by 2-4 people, so invite some friends!\n\nThe Monk's Riddle has been built using just the basic tools at \"help building\". These are explained in just 20 lines! So it is a great example to learn what you can build.\n\nI almost forgot! Join our discord so we can chat!\nhttps://discord.gg/CnQD9g3U5g\n\nThank you so much for playing. Have fun! :-)\n\nOliver",
