 Monk's Riddle puts you and your friends in a seemingly abandoned monastery. 
\r\nYou'll need to explore it, find clues and solve puzzles in order to discover
 \r\nwhat happened to its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe game lasts between 20-60 
minutes. 2 to 4 players are recommended so consider\r\n bringing some friends 
with you. You can communicate using the say and shout \r\nverbs, or use a voice 
chat app like Discord. (You can join our official discord\r\nserver here: 
https://discord.com/invite/CnQD9g3U5g )\r\n\r\nIn the monastery you'll JUST need
 to use these verbs:\r\n  look <item>   - to take a close look and find 
clues\r\n  go <exit>     - to travel between the different rooms\r\n  exits
         - conveniently lists the obvious exits of the room\r\n  items         -
 lists the obvious items of the room\r\n\r\nWhen you enter a room first read its
 description. Then you can use the \"look\" verb to investigate all things you 
found there. When you have finished investigating, use the \"go\" verb to travel
 between rooms and keep exporing! You can use the \"exits\" and \"items\" verbs 
to see what you can interact with in the room if you get stuck.\r\n\r\nKeep in 
mind that there may be hidden item or exits, and these won't be listed by the 
\"exits\" or \"items\" verbs! Carefully reading item decriptions will allow you 
to find them.\r\n\r\nAlso, I recommend you to open a notepad so you can 
copy-paste cryptic clues that\r\n you may find. They may become meaningful 
later.\r\n\r\nNow go through the portal, and good luck!",
